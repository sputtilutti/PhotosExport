# PhotosExport
Apple (mac) Photos export script. AppleScript that exports photos

I wanted a solution to automate export of images in Photos. The photos are organized in albums within folders:
```
  <Folder>
    <Album>
      <photos>
```
Photos are exported to a given location on your disk and maintains the folder-album structure through directories.

# Dependencies

Requires [Photos Utilitities library](https://photosautomation.com/scripting/script-library-01.html)

# Usage

1. Open the script in Mac Script Editor
2. Press "run", it will ask where you want to put the exported files
